# Coding Standards

## Intro

This document describes Mbed TLS preferences for code formatting,
naming conventions, API conventions, coding style, file structure, and
default content.

*Note*: There are situations where we deviate from this document for
'local' reasons.


## Code Formatting

Mbed TLS source code files use 4 spaces for indentation, **not tabs**,
with a preferred maximum line length of 80 characters.

Every code statement should be on its own line.

Avoid statements like this:

```c
    if( a == 1 ) { b = 1; do_function( b ); }
    if( a == 1 ) do_function( a );
```

### Space placement

Mbed TLS uses a non-standard space placement throughout the code, where
there is no space between a function name and all parentheses are
separated by one space from their content:

```c
    if( ( ret = demo_function( a, b, c ) ) != 0 )
```

The same applies to function definitions:

```c
    int demo_function( int a, const unsigned char *value, size_t len )
```

There are a few exceptions to this rule. This includes the preprocessor
directive defined and casts, as well as arguments for function-like
macros:

```c
    #if defined(MBEDTLS_HAVE_TIME)
    timestamp = (uint32_t) time( NULL );
```

### Braces placement and block declaration

Braces (curly brackets) should be located on a line by themselves at
the indentation level of the original block:

```c
    if( do >= 1 )
    {
        if( do == 1 )
        {
            [code block here]
        }
        else
        {
            [alternate code block]
        }
    }
```

In case a block is only single source code line, the braces can be
omitted if the block initiator is only a single line:

```c
    if( do >= 1 )
        a = 2;
```

But not if it is a multi-line initiator:

```c
    if( do >= 1 &&
        this_big_statement_deserved_its_own_line == another_big_part )
    {
        a = 2;
    }
```

### Related lines: Multi-line formatting and indentation

Multiple related source code lines should be formatted to be easily readable:

```c
#define GET_UINT32_LE( n, b, i )                        \
{                                                       \
    (n) = ( (uint32_t) (b)[(i)    ]       )             \
        | ( (uint32_t) (b)[(i) + 1] <<  8 )             \
        | ( (uint32_t) (b)[(i) + 2] << 16 )             \
        | ( (uint32_t) (b)[(i) + 3] << 24 );            \
}

if( my_super_var == second_super_var &&
    this_check_will_do != the_other_value )

do_function( ctx, this_is_a_value, value_b,
                  the_special_var );

void this_is_a_function( context_struct *ctx, size_t length,
                         unsigned char *result );
```


### Extra parentheses for return and sizeof

Within Mbed TLS return statements use parentheses to contain their value:

```c
    return( 0 );
```

Similarly, sizeof expressions always use parentheses even when it is
not necessary (when taking the size of an object):

```c
    memset( buf, 0, sizeof( buf ) );
```

### Precompiler directives

When using precompiler directives to enable or disable parts of the
code, use `#if defined` instead of `#ifdef`. Add a comment to the `#endif`
directive if the distance to the opening directive is bigger than a few
lines or contains other directives:

```c
    #if define(MBEDTLS_HAVE_FEATURE)
    [ten lines of code or other directives]
    #endif /* MBEDTLS_HAVE_FEATURE */
```

## Naming conventions

### Name spacing

All public names (functions, variables, types, enum constants, macros)
must start with either `MBEDTLS_` or `mbedtls_`, usually followed by the
name of the module they belong to (and submodule if applicable),
followed by a descriptive part. Macros and enum constants are uppercase
with underscores; other names are lowercase with underscores:

```c
    mbedtls_x509_crt_parse_file()
    mbedtls_aes_setkey_decrypt()
```

### Local names

Static functions and macros that are not in public headers follow the
same convention except the initial `MBEDTLS_` or `mbedtls_` prefix: they
start directly with the function name.

Function parameters and local variables need no name spacing. They
should use descriptive names unless they're very short-lived or are
used for simple looping or are "standard" names (such as `p` for a
pointer to the current position in a buffer).

### Lengths and sizes

By default all lengths and sizes are in bytes (or in number of
elements, for arrays). If a name refers to a length or size in bits (as
is often the case for key sizes) then the name must explicitly include
`bit`, for example `mbedtls_pk_get_bitlen()` returns the size of the
key in bits, while `mbedtls_pk_get_len()` returns the size in bytes. In
addition, the documentation should always mention explicitly if key
sizes are in bits or in bytes.

## API conventions

### Module contexts

If a module uses a context structure for passing around its state, the
module should contain an `init()` and `free()` function, with the module or
context name prepended to it. The `init()` function must always return
`void`. If some initialization must be done that may fail (such as
allocating memory), it should be done in a separate function, usually
called `setup()`. The `free()` function must free any allocated memory
within the context, but not the context itself. It must set to zero any
data in the context or substructures:

```c
    mbedtls_cipher_context_t ctx;
    mbedtls_cipher_init( &ctx );
    ret = mbedtls_cipher_setup( &ctx, ... );
    /* Check ret, goto cleanup on error */
    /* Do things, goto cleanup on error */
    cleanup:
    mbedtls_cipher_free( &ctx );
```

The goal of separating the `init()` and `setup()` part is that if you have
multiple contexts, you can call all the init() functions first and then
all contexts are ready to be passed to the free() function in case an
error happens in one of the `setup()` functions or elsewhere.

### Return type

Most functions should return `int`, more specifically 0 on success (the
operation was successfully performed, the object checked was found
acceptable, etc.) and a negative error code otherwise. Each module
defines its own error codes, see `error.h` for the allocation scheme.
Exceptions to this rule:

* Functions that can never fail should either return `void` (such as
  `mbedtls_cipher_init()`) or directly the information requested (such as
  `mbedtls_mpi_get_bit()`).
* Functions that look up some information should return either a pointer
  to this information or `NULL` if it wasn't found.
* Some functions may multiplex the return value, such as `mbedtls_asn1_write_len()`
  returns the length written on success or a negative error code. This mimics
  the behavior of some standard functions such as `write()` and `read()`, except
  there is no equivalent to errno: the return code should be specific enough.
* Some internal functions may return -1 on errors rather than a specific error
  code; it is then up to the calling function to pick a more appropriate error
  code if the error is to be propagated back to the user.
* Functions whose name clearly indicates a boolean (such as, the name contains
  "has", "is" or "can") should return 0 for false and 1 for true. The name must
  be clear: for example, mbdtls_has_foobar_support() will return 1 if support
  for foobar is present; by contrast, mbedtls_check_foobar_support() will
  return 0 if support for foobar is present (success) and -1 or a more specific
  error code if not. All functions named check must follow this rule and return
  0 to indicate acceptable/valid/present/etc. Preference should generally be
  given to check names in order to avoid a mixture of == 0 and != 0 tests.
* Functions called `cmp` must return 0 if the two arguments are equal, and if
  it makes sense, should return -1 or 1 to indicate which argument is greater.

### Limited use of in-out parameters

Function should avoid in-out parameters for length (multiplexing buffer
size on entry with length used/written on exit) since they tend to
impair readability. For example:

```c
    mbedtls_write_thing( void *thing, unsigned char *buf, size_t *len ); // no
    mbedtls_write_thing( void *thing, unsigned char *buf, size_t buflen,
                         size_t *outlen ); // yes
```

You can use in-out parameters for functions that receive a pointer to
some buffer, and update it after parsing from or writing to that
buffer:

```c
    mbedtls_asn1_get_int( unsigned char **p,
                          const unsigned char *end,
                          int *value );
```

In that case, the `end` argument should always point to one past the one
of the buffer on entry.

Also, contexts are usually in-out parameters, which is acceptable.

### Const correctness

Function declarations should keep const correctness in mind when
declaring function arguments. Arguments that are pointers and are not
changed by the functions should be marked as such:

```c
    int do_calc_length( const unsigned char *str )
```

## Coding style

### ISO C99

The code uses the C99 ISO standard starting Mbed TLS 2.18.

### Proper argument and variable typing

Type function arguments and variables properly. Specifically, the int
and size fields hold their maximum length in a platform-independent
way. For buffer length, this almost always means using `size_t`.

For values that can't be negative, use unsigned variables. Keep the
type in mind when building loops with unsigned variables.

### Goto

Use of `goto` is allowed in functions that have to do cleaning up before
returning from the function even when an error has occurred. It can
also be used to exit nested loops. In other cases the use of `goto`
should be avoided.

### Exit early and prevent nesting

Structure functions to exit or `goto` the exit code as early as possible.
This prevents nesting of code blocks and improves code readability.

### External function dependencies

Mbed TLS code should minimize use of external functions. Standard libc
functions are allowed, but should be documented in the [KB article on
external dependencies](https://tls.mbed.org/kb/development/what-external-dependencies-does-mbedtls-rely-on).

### Minimize code based on precompiler directives

To minimize the code size and external dependencies, the availability
of modules and module functionality is controlled by precompiler
directives located in `config.h`. Each module should have at least its
own module define for enabling or disabling the module altogether.
Other files using the module header should only include the header file
if the module is actually available.

Since often systems that use Mbed TLS do not have a file system,
functions specifically using the file system should be contained in
`MBEDTLS_FS_IO` directives.

### Minimize use of macros

Avoid using macros unless:
* Readability actually improves with use of the macro.
* Code size is drastically impacted.

The following define actually makes the code using it easier to read.

```c
#define GET_UINT32_LE( n, b, i )                        \
{                                                       \
    (n) = ( (uint32_t) (b)[(i)    ]       )             \
        | ( (uint32_t) (b)[(i) + 1] <<  8 )             \
        | ( (uint32_t) (b)[(i) + 2] << 16 )             \
        | ( (uint32_t) (b)[(i) + 3] << 24 );            \
}
```

### Clear security-relevant memory after use

Memory that contains security-relevant information should be set to
zero after use, and before being released to be reused. Use the
function `mbedtls_platform_zeroize()` to prevent unwanted compiler
optimization.

### Clear and free what you made

The module that allocated a piece of heap memory is also responsible
for releasing it later on unless explicitly documented in the function
definition in the header file. Module self_test()

Each module should have a self-test function (between a check for
`MBEDTLS_SELF_TEST`). This function should test basic module sanity, but
stay away from performing time-consuming tests.

### Doxygen documentation formatting

The header files should be documented with Doxygen-style code comments.
Use the '\' character as a separator.

| Function   | Description                                                         |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| \brief     | A useless function present for documentation purposes.              |
| \note      | This function has no influence on code security.                    |
| \param buf | Buffer to ignore.                                                   |
| \param len | Length of buffer.                                                   |
| \return    | 0 if successfully ignored, otherwise, a module-specific error code. |

## Loose coupling interfaces

Each module should keep loose coupling with external modules and functions in mind. Use flexible function pointers over hard functions calls in cases where you want to replace part of the code with a local version.

## Generic file structure

### Header files

Structure header files as follows:

* License Part (APACHE).
* Header file define for `MBEDTLS_ {MODULE_NAME} _H`:
    ```c
    #ifndef MBEDTLS_AES_H
    #define MBEDTLS_AES_H
    ```
* Includes.
* Public defines (Generic and error codes) and portability code.
* C++ wrapper for C code:
    ```c
    #ifdef __cplusplus
    extern "C" {
    #endif
    ```
* For modules with optional alternative implementations, check for module specific structures:
    ```c
    #if !defined(MBEDTLS_AES_ALT)
    ```
* Public structures that can have alternative implementations.
* For modules with optional alternative implementations, include the alternative header file:
    ```c
    #else  /* MBEDTLS_AES_ALT */
    #include "aes_alt.h"
    #endif /* MBEDTLS_AES_ALT */
    ```
* Public structures that should not have alternative implementations.
* Function declarations.
* C++ end wrapper:
    ```c
    #ifdef __cplusplus
    }
    #endif
    ```
* Header file end define:
    ```c
    #endif /* MBEDTLS_AES_H */
    ```

### Source files

Source files are structured as follows:
* License Part (APACHE).
* Comments on possible standard documents used.
* Config include and precompiler directive for module:
    ```c
    #if !defined(MBEDTLS_CONFIG_FILE)
    #include "mbedtls/config.h"
    #else
    #include MBEDTLS_CONFIG_FILE
    #endif

    #if defined(MBEDTLS_AES_C)
    ```
* Includes.
* Precompiler directive for alternative implementation:
    ```c
    #if !defined(MBEDTLS_AES_ALT)
    ```
* Private local defines and portability code.
* Static variables.
* Function definitions.
* Precompiler directive for marking the end of an alternative implementation:
    ```c
    #endif /* !MBEDTLS_AES_ALT */
    ```
* Precompiler directive for selftest (where applicable):
    ```c
    #if defined(MBEDTLS_SELF_TEST)
    ```
* Self-test test vectors.
* Self test implementation.
* Precompiler directive for marking the end of self tests (where applicable):
    ```c
    #endif /* MBEDTLS_SELF_TEST */
    ```
* Precompiler directive for marking the end of a module:
    ```c
    #endif /* MBEDTLS_AES_C */
    ```
